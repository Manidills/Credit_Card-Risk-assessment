# Credit_Card-Risk-assessment

pystacknet is a light python version of StackNet which was originally made in Java.

Here we used pystacknet one of the best stacking lib that used to stack multiple models to one. we tried to predict the credit card Risk analysis by using the boosting techinques with the help of pystacknet.

Why we need stacking !?

   Stacking works well on most of the time compare to single model but many don't know well about stacking... pystacknet is comes with the easy way to implement the stacking. But stacking is always not a best solution.
